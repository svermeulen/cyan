# Release checklist

When making a release of cyan, make sure to do the following:

 - Make sure everything builds and tests pass.
 - Make sure that autogenerated docs are up to date.
 - Update [`CHANGELOG.md`](/CHANGELOG.md).
 - Update [`cyan/meta.tl`](/src/cyan/meta.tl) to reflect the new version.
 - Copy [`cyan-dev-1.rockspec`](/cyan-dev-1.rockspec) to
   `cyan-$VERSION-1.rockspec` and update its version and reference the git tag
   of this release by adding `tag = "$VERSION"` to the `source` field.
 - Make a commit. Ideally with a message like "Release $VERSION", "Version bump", etc.
 - Git push to run CI, ensuring that everything works as expected.
 - Tag that commit with the version and push the tag (`git push --tags`)
 - Upload the new rockspec.
 - Update [`cyan/meta.tl`](/src/cyan/meta.tl) by adding `+dev` to the version.
 - Make a new commit and push it.
 - If it's a particularly interesting release, announce it in places like the matrix chat.
